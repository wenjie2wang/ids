# Data Science Competition


## Exercises

1. Kaggle hosts many data science competitions. This exercise is
   designed to get familiar with Kaggle and publish your notebook on
   Kaggle. Take the credit card fraud detection as an example:
   <https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud>.
    + Download the dataset; put it in a folder that has the same file
     structure as what is expected in the Kaggle notebook. Do not,
     however, add this file to the repo (so it is local only).
    + Do some exploratory data analysis and summarize your findings in
     a report (with both texts and code chunks).
    + Upload your notebook to Kaggle.
