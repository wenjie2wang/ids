    "\n",
    "Time optimization is one most common reason for timing and\n",
    "profiling. The understanding is that only some small chunk often makes\n",
    "our code heavy in terms of time taken, memory usage, etc. Finding it\n",
    "and improving or managing it can improve our resource usage.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is especially important to profile code chunks to optimize them. This becomes\n",
    "more important in a production environment where resources are expensive and\n",
    "cannot be wasted. Therefore, as part of testing, one should include profiling to\n",
    "see which chunks use most resources and which chunks use less. Some coding\n",
    "contests often have a maximum time to run and these situations also\n",
    "lead to its necessity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources mostly profiled\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common resources that we often optimize for projects are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- CPU time\n",
    "- Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "But some other resources could also be network bandwidth usage etc. For example,\n",
    "if you wish to create a notebook that gathers stock data from one of many\n",
    "locations such as Yahoo Finance etc, and you only have a limited bandwidth, your\n",
    "choice could also depend on where you gather your data from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Profiling CPU time\n",
    "Profiling implies that it divides the entire code file into smaller code chunks\n",
    "(*functions/lines*) in order to show the resource usage and thus existence of\n",
    "bottlenecks in our code. It is best practice to find bottlenecks by means of\n",
    "profiling rather than by intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python includes the following modules that achieve profiling for CPU time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- timeit\n",
    "- cprofile\n",
    "- profile\n",
    "- lineprofile\n",
    "\n",

    "The profiler modules are designed to provide an execution profile for a\n",
    "given program, not for benchmarking purposes (for that, there is timeit for\n",
    "reasonably accurate results). This particularly applies to benchmarking Python\n",
    "code against C code: the profilers introduce overhead for Python code, but not\n",
    "for C-level functions, and so the C code would seem faster than any Python\n",
